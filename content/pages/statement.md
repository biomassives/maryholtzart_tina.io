      Art makes me happy and brings me extreme joy. I have drawn my whole life.
      I get lost in the experience and find that creating art is the perfect
      anti-depressant, and in that healing power, I can find myself. When the
      waking world leaves me weary, I always find solace getting in the flow of
      creating art.


      As part of my education in Metaphysical Healing and Interpersonal
      Psychotherapy (Masters and Doctoral Degrees) I was trained in Intuitive
      Art Therapy. Using pastels and markers, the image that emerges can be
      analyzed by reading the energy that it represents and, perhaps finding a
      message in the shapes and forms. I have the pleasure of teaching this art
      form.


      I recently redefined my life after a disabling accident seven years ago
      left me with pain that blocked my natural abilities to access my psychic
      awareness and intuitive abilities as a medium.


      After learning Alcohol Ink, something wonderful and magical happened! My
      psychic abilities awakened once again, empowering me to feel that cosmic
      conscious connection and spiritual energy.&#x20;
