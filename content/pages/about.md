      Native Floridian and artist, Mary Holtz, has always had the passion and
      skills for interpreting the visual whether seen through the eyes or felt
      in the spirit. Her life passions are healing those in need and creating
      art in mixed mediums. An avid photographer, Mary has experience and
      education in alcohol ink, acrylics, wire wrapping jewelry, crafting,
      Sumi-e-ink art, Japanese floral design, Ikebana, and intuitive pastel art.


      Her energy for art is unending even as she has spent the last forty-six
      years healing the sick and needy as a Registered Nurse, an Acupuncture
      Physician, and a Transpersonal Psycho-Spiritual Therapist. In 2010 she
      received a Ph.D. in Metaphysical Healing and Transpersonal
      Psycho-Spiritual Therapy which included intuitive art interpretation. Her
      mediumship skills bring an insightful understanding of her art forms.


      Recently, she has been educated in the field of alcohol ink taking classes
      from Linda Clifford and Alexis Bonavitacola.


      She prides herself on seeing color, shape, and dimension not through
      conventional eyes but through deep, other-dimensional energy. She
      currently shows her art at craft fairs, restaurants, and local community
      events. You can find Mary on Facebook, Mary Holtz Art
